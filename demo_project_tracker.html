- Projects takes too much (1 year taking requirements, 10 months
  developing,...)

- Agile applies to project, people relationships,...
  prioritization of tasks, ...  better visibility,
  better prioritization, less downtime between tasks,
  Improved teamwork

- What's a task:
  A case study / promo-video / market-research /... ? NO. Too long.
  A task in agile is something that takes more than 30 minutes and less 
  than 3 days.

- How to estimate the time?
  Estimating is hard.
  Use story points (vs hours):
      1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48
      This could map (not necesarely) to:
      30min, 1hour, 2hours, 4hours, 1day, 2days, 3days.

SCRUM vs KANBAN: 
  Both are subsets of Agile.
  SCRUM targets dead-lines. (fixed dates)
   * Releases are more important that "what's in".
   * Delay release or drop feature?
   * Uses a PLAN MODE

  Kanban:
   * Service team. new tickets  always coming in.
   * Prioritizing the tickets (tasks) and doing in the right order
     is more important than how many are done in a week.
   * No Plan mode, no Sprints. 
     PLAN MODE:
   * Do NOT uses a PLAN MODE

<span xsmall>MoSCoW Task Prioritization</span>
  MoSCoW method  is  one  of  the  most  used  prioritization  
techniques  in  the  project  management  and software development 
and for this reason it was selected in the current deliverable. 

  Its primary role is to define a common baseline with partners on how 
they evaluate (e.g. most important/important/least important/etc.) 
each defined requirement. 

The acronym, MoSCoW, stands for 4 categories of prioritizations:
• "Must  have" requirements are considered vital/critical for the partner in order 
  to obtain a successful  outcome.  As  a  result,  these  are  
  considered  non-negotiable  and  mandatory. Furthermore,  any 
  solution delivered without a requirement tagged as a must is not 
  considered viable.  If a workaround can be found for a requirement, 
  then this is not considered as “Musthave”. 

• "Should have" requirements:
  This  type comprises   all requirements that are not considered vital 
  but are important for the partner. The solution is considered viable 
  even if the requirement is not met. A workaround can be employed and 
  the solution will remain viable.

• "Could have" :
  contains all the  desired  features  that  could improve  the  
  functionality/work  experience  of the  solution  but  do  not  
  affect  the  result.  These  requirements have a minimum impact on 
  the end goal and are usually firstly removed in case of limited 
  timeframes.  

• "Won’t have" : (this time)
  requirements that are not needed at the current time or which do not 
  bring any addition to the value of the desired solution. Such 
  requirements do not have priority at the current moment of time. 

BºAccording  to  literature,  this prioritization  method  is        º
Bºefficient  and  offers  better  results  when  compared  to simplerº
Bºprioritizations approaches like high/medium/low prioritization or  º
Bºsequential prioritization.                                         º

The Least Successful Collector
    Betsy Baker played a central role in the history of collecting.  She
was employed as a servant in the house of John Warburton (1682-1759) who had
amassed a fine collection of 58 first edition plays, including most of the
works of Shakespeare.
    One day Warburton returned home to find 55 of them charred beyond
legibility.  Betsy had either burned them or used them as pie bottoms.  The
remaining three folios are now in the British Museum.
    The only comparable literary figure was the maid who in 1835 burned
the manuscript of the first volume of Thomas Carlyle's "The Hisory of the
French Revolution", thinking it was wastepaper.

"Speak, thou vast and venerable head," muttered Ahab, "which, though
ungarnished with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak,
mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee.  Of all divers,
thou has dived the deepest.  That head upon which the upper sun now gleams has
moved amid the world's foundations.  Where unrecorded names and navies rust,
and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this frigate
earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful
water-land, there was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been where bell or
diver never went; has slept by many a sailer's side, where sleepless mothers
would give their lives to lay them down.  Thou saw'st the locked lovers when
leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting
wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed false to them.  Thou saw'st the
murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell
into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed
on unharmed -- while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would
have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.  O head! thou has
seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one
syllable is thine!"

There is no character, howsoever good and fine, but it can be destroyed by
ridicule, howsoever poor and witless.  Observe the ass, for instance: his
character is about perfect, he is the choicest spirit among all the humbler
animals, yet see what ridicule has brought him to.  Instead of feeling
complimented when we are called an ass, we are left in doubt.

The Bulwer-Lytton fiction contest is held ever year at San Jose State
Univ.  by Professor Scott Rice.  It is held in memory of Edward George
Earle Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873), a rather prolific and popular (in his
time) novelist.  He is best known today for having written "The Last
Days of Pompeii."

Whenever Snoopy starts typing his novel from the top of his doghouse,
beginning "It was a dark and stormy night..." he is borrowing from Lord
Bulwer-Lytton.  This was the line that opened his novel, "Paul Clifford,"
written in 1830.  The full line reveals why it is so bad:

    It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents -- except
    at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of
    wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene
    lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty
    flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.

"Speak, thou vast and venerable head," muttered Ahab, "which, though
ungarnished with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak,
mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee.  Of all divers,
thou has dived the deepest.  That head upon which the upper sun now gleams has
moved amid the world's foundations.  Where unrecorded names and navies rust,
and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this frigate
earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful
water-land, there was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been where bell or
diver never went; has slept by many a sailer's side, where sleepless mothers
would give their lives to lay them down.  Thou saw'st the locked lovers when
leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting
wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed false to them.  Thou saw'st the
murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell
into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed
on unharmed -- while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would
have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.  O head! thou has
seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one
syllable is thine!"

The Least Perceptive Literary Critic
    The most important critic in our field of study is Lord Halifax.  A
most individual judge of poetry, he once invited Alexander Pope round to
give a public reading of his latest poem.
    Pope, the leading poet of his day, was greatly surprised when Lord
Halifax stopped him four or five times and said, "I beg your pardon, Mr.
Pope, but there is something in that passage that does not quite please me."
    Pope was rendered speechless, as this fine critic suggested sizeable
and unwise emendations to his latest masterpiece.  "Be so good as to mark
the place and consider at your leisure.  I'm sure you can give it a better
turn."
    After the reading, a good friend of Lord Halifax, a certain Dr.
Garth, took the stunned Pope to one side.  "There is no need to touch the
lines," he said.  "All you need do is leave them just as they are, call on
Lord Halifax two or three months hence, thank him for his kind observation
on those passages, and then read them to him as altered.  I have known him
much longer than you have, and will be answerable for the event."
    Pope took his advice, called on Lord Halifax and read the poem
exactly as it was before.  His unique critical faculties had lost none of
their edge.  "Ay", he commented, "now they are perfectly right.  Nothing can
be better."

In India, "cold weather" is merely a conventional phrase and has come into

There is no character, howsoever good and fine, but it can be destroyed by
ridicule, howsoever poor and witless.  Observe the ass, for instance: his

complimented when we are called an ass, we are left in doubt.
